If you want to know more about the plot of The Last: Naruto the Movie, here is a brief summary:
 
The movie begins with a flashback of Naruto's childhood, when he met Hinata for the first time and saved her from bullies. Hinata developed a crush on Naruto since then, but was too shy to express her feelings. She also made a red scarf for him as a gift, but never had the chance to give it to him.
 
In the present, Naruto is a hero of the Hidden Leaf Village and is admired by many people, especially young girls. He receives a new scarf from one of his fans, which he wears proudly. Hinata sees this and feels discouraged, thinking that Naruto has forgotten about her. She decides to confess her love to him during the Rinne Festival, a celebration of peace and harmony.
 
However, things go wrong when Toneri Otsutsuki, a descendant of Hamura Otsutsuki, the brother of the Sage of Six Paths, appears and kidnaps Hinata's younger sister Hanabi. Toneri reveals that he plans to use Hanabi's Byakugan eyes to awaken a powerful weapon called the Tenseigan, which can control the moon and destroy the world. He also claims that he is the chosen one to marry Hinata, who is the reincarnation of Hamura's lover.
 
Naruto and his friends, including Sakura, Sai, Shikamaru and Kakashi, form a team to rescue Hanabi and stop Toneri. They travel to the moon using a rocket built by Konohagakure's allies. Along the way, Naruto realizes that he has feelings for Hinata as well, and tries to get closer to her. However, he also faces some challenges from Toneri's puppets and traps.
 
On the moon, Naruto and Hinata confront Toneri, who reveals his hatred for humanity for misusing chakra as a weapon. He also shows them a vision of Hamura's will, which supposedly orders him to destroy mankind. Hinata agrees to go with Toneri in exchange for Hanabi's safety, but secretly plans to destroy the Tenseigan from within.
 
Naruto refuses to give up on Hinata and follows her to Toneri's castle. He fights his way through Toneri's army and reaches his throne room. There, he sees Hinata wearing a wedding dress and seemingly accepting Toneri's proposal. Naruto is heartbroken and enraged, and clashes with Toneri in a fierce battle.
 
Meanwhile, Hinata manages to locate the Tenseigan and uses her own chakra to disable it. She also discovers that Hamura's will was actually a message for her, telling her to protect the world from Toneri's madness. She then rejoins Naruto and helps him defeat Toneri.
 
Naruto and Hinata confess their love for each other and share their first kiss. They also use their combined chakra to stop the moon from falling and restore it to its original orbit. They return to Earth with Hanabi and their friends, and celebrate their victory.
 
The movie ends with Naruto and Hinata getting married in front of their family and friends. Naruto wears his old red scarf that Hinata made for him long ago, while Hinata wears her mother's wedding dress. They exchange vows and kiss again, as everyone cheers for them.
